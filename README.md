# Voxels
Voxel engine in Vulkan. Mostly to learn Vulkan. Also to play around with voxel terrain generation.

## Prerequisites
Vulkan SDK 1.3+ - This project uses Vulkan 1.3. Download the Vulkan SDK from https://vulkan.lunarg.com/.

### Usage
You should be able to clone the repo and build the solution file (voxels.sln) in Visual Studio. I've only tested with Visual Studio 2019 on Windows. 

As stated in the prereqs, you'll need to have the Vulkan SDK downloaded too.

To check your installation, run `echo %VULKAN_SDK%` in a cmd prompt. If everything is right the path should be something like `C:\VulkanSDK\1.3.239.0`. Any version above 1.3 should work.
